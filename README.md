# **LV Segmentation Using Deep Learning Techniques**

## **Overview**
This project aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of Left Ventricle (LV) segmentation in cardiac MRI images using advanced deep learning models. LV segmentation is crucial for medical imaging, helping clinicians assess and diagnose cardiac conditions with greater precision. By leveraging models such as U-Net, Attention U-Net, and V-Net, we aim to provide a robust solution for accurate and fast LV segmentation.

## **Problem Statement**
Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) in cardiac MRI images is a significant challenge in medical imaging. The primary goal is to develop a model that can segment the LV with high precision, enabling better diagnosis and treatment of cardiac diseases.

## **Project Goals**
- **Improve Segmentation Accuracy**: Develop a model that accurately detects LV boundaries.
- **Reduce Processing Time**: Utilize efficient methods that maintain accuracy while decreasing processing time.
- **Enhance Generalization**: Ensure the model performs well across various clinical settings and MRI data types.

## **Data**
The project utilizes publicly available datasets for LV segmentation, such as the ACDC dataset. Proper preprocessing, normalization, and augmentation techniques are applied to improve the model's performance.

## **Methodology**
1. **Data Preparation**: Preprocessing, augmentation, and splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets.
2. **Model Selection**: Evaluation of different deep learning models:
   - **U-Net**: A popular encoder-decoder architecture for biomedical image segmentation.
   - **Attention U-Net**: An improved version of U-Net with an attention mechanism for focusing on important regions in the image.
   - **V-Net**: A 3D convolutional network specifically designed for volumetric medical image segmentation.
3. **Model Training**: Training selected models on prepared data, optimizing hyperparameters, and using advanced techniques to enhance learning.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like Dice Coefficient and Intersection over Union (IoU).
5. **Improvement and Fine-Tuning**: Iteratively refining models by adjusting hyperparameters, applying advanced techniques, and conducting error analysis.
